  <h1>SMS Consent for Internal Providers</h1>

  <p>
    BeWell CRM sends SMS notifications to internal providers (employees and contracted clinicians)
    for operational purposes, including notification of new client intake assignments and follow-up reminders.
  </p>

  <p>
    Providers provide consent to receive SMS notifications during onboarding by supplying their mobile
    phone number and agreeing to receive business-related text messages as part of their role.
  </p>

  <p>
    SMS messages are non-marketing and limited to operational notifications.
    Messages may include a secure, time-limited link to view intake details after authentication.
  </p>

  <p>
    Providers may opt out at any time by replying <strong>STOP</strong>.
    For help, providers may reply <strong>HELP</strong>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Questions may be directed to internal support.
